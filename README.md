## Overview

Weather-SwiftUI is an app that is built using SwiftUI! Check the weather for your favourite countries easily anytime and anywhere.

## Installation

> This app is not currently available on the App Store.

### Build Requirements

- A Mac running macOS Big Sur 11
- Xcode 13
- At least iPhone 11 or above 

### Configuration & Usage

1. Download or pull the project onto your local machine
2. Open the project in Xcode 13 (Minimum)
3. Run the app with the simulator provided

## Limitations
1. The UI design in this application is made specfically for iPhone 11 which means that it may not be optimised for other models.
2. This project is still a work in progress so there might be bugs that are still pending to be fixed.
3. The free API key used in this project only supports up to 60 calls/minute and 1,000,000 calls/month. Due to this limitation, I have tuned down the refresh call rate so as to ensure we do not exceed the maximum calls we have.
